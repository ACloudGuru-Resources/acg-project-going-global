# ACG Project: Going Global - Building Web Apps with Front Door, CI and Cosmos DB
The cloud is everywhere, which means your application can be everywhere too! However, in order to get the most out of globally scaled cloud infrastructure, you have to use the right cloud services. 
In this ACG Project, you'll learn how to create a build pipeline, with Azure DevOps, directly to Azure and provide global performance with Cosmos DB and Azure Front Door.

Yes it's a lot! But the outcome means you'll be able to:
* understand how app services scale globally. 
* be comfortable with using ARM templates for deployment of Azure resources. 
* learn how to integrate multiple Azure services in a simple robust architecture.  
* understand the difference between a relational and NoSQL database.  

Alright, let's get started! Don't forget to view the accompanying [ACG Project here.](https://acloud.guru/series/acg-projects/view/402)
